I'm Javid! If you remember David well, just change D to J. My last name is DadashKarimi. My friends sometimes call me `JDK' which is different from `java development kit'! 
I am so grateful that I spent 2012-2016 with Prof. Azadeh Shakery in University of Tehran. I learnt a lot from her; including cross-language information retrieval and her grate ability in sense of emotional intelligence. I used both these skills here at Yale; We launched a multi-lingual search engine: [material](tangra.cs.yale.edu/material) with lily lab under the supervision of Prof. Dragomir Radev. Honestly I learnt many technichal stuff from this project. Then I moved to another interesting topic: big data and optimization. When you have k sensors to put in a floor that cover it the most, where would you put them? If I was in your shoes, I would act greedy and put the senser with highest coverage in each step in span of time. Then I noticed that this algorithm gives <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=1-1/\epsilon" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1-1/\epsilon" title="1-1/\epsilon" /></a> approximation for maximizing the coverage. 
So apparently, optimization for big data is going to be a fabulous technique! 
But where should I have started? I found Amin Karbasi's working on theory of optimization. I started working on this area and really love this topic; but I'm also a technichal programmer who is interested in application. So I started a rotation with Mark Gerstein's lab in bioinformatic. Genomic might be an ideal application for big data. I will share my findings with you. 
 
### More Information

I'm in New Haven. Currently I'm writing this post in Yale CEID. You can, work, invent, build, and do everything here. A guy asking me to sign a letter since they are filming right there. I don't know the name of the movie though. New haven is famous for pizza. I tried frank pepe which always is crowded. Last time it took 45 mins to get in.
