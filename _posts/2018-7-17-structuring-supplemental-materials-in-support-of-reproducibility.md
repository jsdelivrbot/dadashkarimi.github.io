title: Structuring supplemental materials in support of reproducibility
---
Yay! Big data. The problem I was talkig about [here](/https://dadashkarimi.github.io/about/). Since is rapidly increasing. How we can succinctly represent the content of a research paper with supplementary documents. According to this proposal, supplements should have the following standards:
1. Findable: both for human and machines (e.g., using identifiers)
2. Accessible: available for long term (e.g., lincences)
3. Interoperable: via shared vocabulary, references, ..
4. Reusable: I and machine can follow it and do research!
