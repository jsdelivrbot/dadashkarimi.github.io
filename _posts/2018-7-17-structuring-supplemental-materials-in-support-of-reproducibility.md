title: Structuring supplemental materials in support of reproducibility

![_config.yml](/images/supplementary_1@3x.png)

Yay! Big data. The problem I was talkig about [here](/https://dadashkarimi.github.io/about/). Since is rapidly increasing. How we can succinctly represent the content of a research paper with supplementary documents. According to this proposal, supplements should have the following standards:
1. Findable: both for human and machines (e.g., using identifiers)
2. Accessible: available for long term (e.g., lincences)
3. Interoperable: via shared vocabulary, references, ..
4. Reusable: I and machine can follow it and do research!

Fig. 1 Each section in supplementary document followed by <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\sum" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\sum" title="\sum" /></a>. If a section is not parallel with text, it is denoted by <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=/" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?/" title="/" /></a> line.
