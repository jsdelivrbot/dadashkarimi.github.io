title: Reproducable Research
---
In this paper, the authors propose to use some standards to make a scientific paper reproducable. 
They defined some recomendations for scientists, some for funding agencies, and some for journal editors. 
For example they proposed authors put links for source code and define different versioning after modification. 
They even proposed to provide a virtual environment to replicate the experiments in paper. 
For funding agencies, they porposed to fund some group to replicate publications or some organizations hosting data and code uploads. 
It was recomended to support provenance and workflow tracking tools that smooths code replication process. 
For journal editors they also provided some recomendations like requiring code and data before publication.
Editors can put some signs over title indicating either code or data availability.
