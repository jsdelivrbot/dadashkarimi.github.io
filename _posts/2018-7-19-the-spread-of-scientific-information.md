title: The Spread of Scientific Information
---
In this paper authors investigate at information diffusion in academia based on average html accesses, views, pdf downloads, citations. 
The results show that rate of diffusion after one month of publication drops rapidly but after that slow decay with power low happens.
The reason might be sharing the papers in local community after first days of publishing papers through social media.
The also modeled this changes by a stochastic function.
