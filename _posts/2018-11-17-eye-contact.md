title: How Eye Contact can Save the World
---

In world war I approximately 37 million people were killed. 21 years later further 60 million people died in the scond world war. 
It's true that widespread media helped to decreas the number of wars and conflicts significantly.
But have you ever thought about why all these conflicts happend. The main reason is hatred. 
Hatred starts from each person and ends up with brutal dictators and leaders. 
When I was at home, my friends used to call me "The King of Hearts" or the person with "Charm Smiles". 
Sometimes my aunts and uncles say that "You lived in this World once before."
Or when I asked my friend if it's disgusting to say this bartender looks like Lady Gaga and he said nothing is disgusting with your smiles.
I'm writing this blog to let people know what was the reason behind my charisma and why people like me.

It was long times ago that I started thinking  why today was a "good" day or it was a "terrible" day.
In most cases I realised that my good days started with a charm eye contact or a positive comment on my appearance. 
On the other hand my "terrible" days were full of eye ignorance by people in sidewalk or in other side of traffic lights.
I got unlimitted positive energy when a girl, a grandparent, or a father gave 3 seconds of eyecontact with smile on me. 
I got unlimitted negative energy when a girl ruuning toward me to catch a trafic light, checking her phone for long time, and generally when I feel ignorance by people. 
Then I started to give 3 sec smile to people when I go to office or back to home. Almost always when I was able to catch up eyes, and get positive energy back with another smile. 
You can't beleive that every day I get infinite amount of positive energy with so many smiles that I get from people during my walk, no matter how old they are and which races they are belonging to. 

By ignoring people with our lack of eye contact, we are killing them in span of time. We are killing people but newspapers are not able report it. We are literally pushing people in hell without feeling guilty. 
We are pooshing people in a long chain of negative feeling ends up with depression and death. 
And as you know depressed people are kind of walking deads. 
We should be more respectful in our communications and more skillfull in our eye contact. 
No need to look around the face, just focus on eyes.
I'm pretty sure we can decrease the number of depression casualties in the world which is more than World Wars' casualties all together.
