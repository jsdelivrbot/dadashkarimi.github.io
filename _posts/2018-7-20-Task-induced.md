title: Task-induced brain state manipulation improves prediction of individual traits
---

The idea is pretty cool. Imaging subjects while they are doing some cognitive tasks ends up with better prediction models. 
These models are going to predict behavioral or cognitive states of the subjects.
Based on this paper's terminology there are two types of data:
1. rest data: data obtained while subjects are in rest state.
2. task data: data obtained while subjects doing some tasks (i.e., gambling, language, motor, relational, social, working memory, and emotion).
