title: Task-induced brain state manipulation improves prediction of individual traits
---

The idea is pretty cool. Imaging subjects while they are doing some cognitive tasks ends up with better prediction models. 
These models are going to predict behavioral or cognitive states of the subjects.
Based on this paper's terminology there are two types of data:
1. rest data: data obtained while subjects are in rest state.
2. task data: data obtained while subjects doing some tasks (i.e., gambling, language, motor, relational, social, working memory, and emotion).
The could obtain interesting results.
They have reached consistent improvement compared to the the data have been taken in rest condition.
Additionally, they reported the results are dependant on sex.
For examples in connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) that was built from data obtained during working memory reaches out better results than emotion in male while for female the opposit event holds. 
The authors stepped forward and examined sex specific tasks and report surther significant improvement in best achieved models.
