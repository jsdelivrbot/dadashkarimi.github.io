title: Getting Started in Text Mining
---

This paper is very cool. In this paper the authors shed light on joint areas between information retrieval, natural language processing, and computational biology.
The goal of this paper is to propose a way for understanding system biology papers. 
The framework they proposed, contains an information retrieval component at the first stage. 
Then they proposed to have a named entity recognition system before information extraction.
Ultimately the extracted information is going to be used through question answering framework. 
The main differece of this type of QA systems with traditional ones, is on the output of this system where you can find non-textual data including MAP, connections, graphs and so on.
