title: EM for Query Translation in CLIR
---

In this paper, the authors propose a new method to refine the query language model based on top-ranked documents. In CLIR setting, we can have both source language documents and target language documents. Source language documents are retrieved in response to the native speaker subject, and the target language documents are retrieved in response to a translation of it.
