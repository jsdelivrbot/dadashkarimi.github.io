title: I've started a rotation with Dust Scheinost!
---

In July 18 2018, I started a rotation with [Prof. Dustin Scheinost](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oa8M4LoAAAAJ&hl=en). In FMRI group people working on brain imaging and behavioral studies. I'm going to apply some semi-supervised and supervised techniques to this aim. My terminology in this area is super basic but Dustin pointed me to some of his papers! Follow me ..
