title: Temporal Dynamics of Collaborative Networks in Large Scientific Consortia.
---

This paper investigates at temporal changes in collaborative networks. 
The goal of the paper is to study impact of scientific consortia in publishing papers and contributing in academia. 
The expeirments on consortia ended up with Higgs boson and ENCyclopedia Of DNA reveals that papers that use data generated from these community are rapidly increasing. 
In other case study the authors studied data from 1000 genome and they showed that at initial years of publishing these data, collaborators in consortia were very tight to each other and keep their collaboration in later years but in span of time the authors used these data made local communities and independant modules.
