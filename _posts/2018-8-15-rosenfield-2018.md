title: Semi-Supervised Learning with Competitive Infection Models
---

Semi-supervised learning has been widely studied in whole bunch of different fields.
The problem is defined by a set of examples ($x_i$,$y_i$) where $y_i$ is the labeld assigned for a feature vector $x_i$ and another set of examples ($x_j$,$f_j$) where $f_j$ is our estimation for example $x_j$. The former set is in size of $L$ and the latter one is $U$.
The work by (Zhu, Ghahramani, and Lafferty,2003) probably is the most cited paper in this area. 
They claim that like what happens in Physics our network of examples remains stable while it minimizes an energy function:

\beging{equation}
E(f) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j} w_{i,j} (f(i)-f(j))^2
\label{eq:energy}
\end{equation}

where $w_{i,j}$ is the element in weight matrix $W[w_{i,j}]$ between examples $x_i$ and $x_j$. $y_i=f(i)$ if $x_i$ is a member of our labled set.
The function that minimizes Eq. \ref{eq:energy} should be harmonic: $\Delta f =0$ on unlabled data. Here $\Delta=W-D$ is the combinatorial laplacian where $D=diag(di)$. A harmonic solution for this problem is:
\beging{equation}
f(j) = \frac{1}{d_j} \sum_{i~j} w_{i,j} f(i), j=L+1,..,L+U
\label{eq:average}
\end{equation}

Since some neighbours of node $x_j$ is labled and some not, this problems is assumed to have an iterative solution.
They proposed a closed form solution
