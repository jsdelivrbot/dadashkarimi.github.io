In July 18 2018, I started rotation with [Prof. Dustin Scheinost](https://medicine.yale.edu/mrrc/faculty/dustin_scheinost.profile). In this lab I'm so curious to see how I can adapt my expieriences in machine learning on brain imaging. 
I talked with students working their lab and I should attend their group meetings Friday July 20 at 11 AM. Students seem to be very happy and productive and I like the working envirenment. Apparently I'm going to do some supervised/semi-supervised learning to predict subject's behavioral status. I'm not pretty sure how much big data is a challenge here but I found my running work with Alex Fabbri on data augmentation very useful here. Since they might have few number of exampels in each class they need to have more examples. Let's see how it goes!
