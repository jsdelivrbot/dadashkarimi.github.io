title: Rotation with Dustin Scheinost (FMRI Group)
---

In July 18 2018, I started rotation with [Prof. Dustin Scheinost](https://medicine.yale.edu/mrrc/faculty/dustin_scheinost.profile). In this lab I'm so curious to see how I can adapt my expieriences in machine learning on brain imaging. I talked with students working their lab and I should attend their group meetings Friday July 20 at 11 AM. Students seem to be very happy and productive and I like the working envirenment.
